# Uber
- Read and cleaned the original data using pandas,dropped collumns that I didn't need and had a brief look at the dataset
- Made charts that are easy to understand

# Charts:
- Total number of rides,Completed/Incomlpeted,Cancelled number of rides presented with Card to see how cleary how many rides there are
- Stacked bar chart for to represent type of rides in the chart and where we can see difference in %
- Cancelled rides reasons by driver in pie chart
- Cancelled rides reasons by customer in Customer chart
- Incomplete rides reasons

- Completed rides top pick up locations
- Completed rides top drop off locations
- Completed rides most used type of vehicle
- Sum of ride distance by quater and month (the dataset only contains 2024) to see which months had the most distance,where we can see February,by far, had the lowest ride distance
- Complete rides by Time also can represent when most of rides are happening which is around 11:30 pm and post work hours at around 6 pm

- Total rides with drivers ratings,we can see most drivers sit inbetween 4.0 and 4.5,and there's not many of them below 3.5
- Total rides with customer rating,similar to drivers,but way more customers with rating between 4.5 and 5,and the dropoff seems to be similar after 3.5,even more for customers
